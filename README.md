- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @0xFable
- I put a special focus on making accessible applications for everyone which look beautiful on every device.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on anything with CosmWasm or Cosmos
- üì´ How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xFab1e)

I am interested in a lot of the core tech of Cosmos SDK, IBC, and Tendermint. Give me a shout if you want to have a coffee.

Take a look at my team's submission to the [Next Top Blockchain Startup Here](https://devpost.com/software/white-whale)! We came together as a team of strangers and are now building a project for the community. The icing on the cake was we won both the Open Innovation Grand Prize - Hosted by BitMart, Future Tech & GDA Ventures for the hackathon as well as 1 of the winners of the Building Defi for the Masses - Hosted by Terra powered by LUNA. 

Really love building tooling and things related to security so when I can I try to build some cool tool such as 
- [Capsule](https://github.com/0xFable/capsule) a small developer tool to make deploying CosmWasm contracts easier.
- [cw-lint](https://github.com/0xFable/cw-lint) a dylint-based linting library for CosmWasm.
- [Lexicon](https://github.com/0xFable/lexicon) simple enough mkdocs template to get your protocols docs started.
- [cw-minimal-template](https://github.com/0xFable/cw-minimal-template) smallest possible code contract to get your new contracts started quickly
- [Dev Notes](https://github.com/0xFable/terra-dev-notes) different problems and how I overcome them as I go, surely someone will encounter them again and then hopefully they find the notes :-)
