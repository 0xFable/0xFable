- 👋 Hi, I’m @0xFable
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain development and developing solutions to help others with their financial challenges.
- I put a special focus on making accessible applications for everyone which look beautiful on every device.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Terra Luna projects, anything with cosmwasm or Cosmos
- 📫 How to reach me Twitter

Take a look at my teams submission to the [Next Top Blockchain Startup Here](https://devpost.com/software/white-whale)! We came together as a team of strangers and are now building a project for the community. The icing on the cake was we won both the Open Innovation Grand Prize - Hosted by BitMart, Future Tech & GDA Ventures for the hackathon as well as 1 of the winners of the Building DeFi for the Masses - Hosted by Terra powered by LUNA. 

Also take a look at [Capsule](https://github.com/0xFable/capsule) a small developer tool to make deploying CosmWasm contracts easier.
